# Homework-1 

## Code Refractor

### The Repository
My homework-1 repository contains both the HTML and CSS files for [Horiseon Social Solutions Services](https://joshherrera09.github.io/Homework-1/Code-refractor.html) As well as all of the images used for the webpage.

#### Description
We were given both HTMl and CSS files along with the images of the website and sought to refractor the code, to easier to read, follow and edit in the future.

With the code more concise and easier to read it will be more efficient for anyone working on the site in the future to add/make changes to the website.

### Notable Changes

* Added smeantic elemtent sections to the HTML
* Added alt tags to all photos
* Changed the title of the website to be more fitting and descriptive of the site
* Made the CSS more concise and easier to read by grouping together multiple elements, instead of having a rule-set for each individual element
* Fixed the link in the header for the Search Engine Optimization button
* Added comments describing the intent of the code for both HTMl and CSS files

### Lessons Learned and Still Learning
* After changing the location of the images used on the site, I realized I would need to also update the file paths for the images to load properly
* Need to continue to practice writing efficient comments on lines of code
* Proper paths to images/links/CSS files
* Introduced to how to use semantic elements in HTML to organize and help read code easier
